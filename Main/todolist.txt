Main Page - Difficulty: 1 
    > Registration Google Form Link
        - Embed the form itself later
    > Rules + Staff Link
    > Leaderboard Link
        - Show top 10 per region or top 25 if global
    > Team Balancer Spreadsheet Link - until I figure out how to make a better visual/live updater for it
    > Discord Link
    
Rules + Staff Page - Difficulty: 1
    > Literally Just Rules
    > Current list of staff + regions
    
Leaderboards Page - Difficulty: 3 (hardest part is accessing sheet, sorting algorithms arent too bad)
    > Pull info from leaderboard spreadsheet
    > Seperate Per region? - NA/EU/SEA
    > Default sort on rank
    > Sort based on categories - does not affect original sheet
    > Sort Numerically for rank value, wins, losses, win rate - min/max or max/min
    > Sort Alphabetically for username
    > Sort Region? (if global)
Future Team Balancer Page - Difficulty: ? (accessing sheet, dynamically updating, shit looks scary lamo)
    > Balance algorithm - Average Rank Values per team should be similar if not equal
    Actual Implementation:    
        > Dynamically update for anyone looking on it
            - One person makes a change, everyone in the lobby can see
            - Can join queue channel, put name down in the form, and just wait
        > 3 or 6 Different lobbies? 1 or 2 per region (doubt we need more)
            - Because of dynamic updating
            - Might need multiple queues if multiple games go on at the same time
    
    Potential Temp Fixes:
        > Embed spreadsheet
            - Looks ugly as shit
            - No different than a hyperlink to the spreadsheet itself
            - Dynamic Updating
            - Not sure if it lets you edit on the site, might have to be on the actual spreadsheet to change
        > Static Page
            - One person goes on the page (call him User)
            - User inputs the names (and regions?) of the 10 players
            - Pull data from leaderboard spreadsheet
            - Generate balanced teams from data
            - Generate randomized/unique link for teams that User can then copy + paste for everyone to see
            - Page is unique to User, no one else will see what he is doing
            - Only needs a single form as its static and unique per User
    
    
Overall Difficulty: 3.5
    > Need to make it more aesthetic than google sheets
    > Background image or solid color?
    > Permanently dark/night mode because light mode is for losers
    > Need to make a menu bar or drop down (probably bar)
    > Menu Bar has to work on any page
