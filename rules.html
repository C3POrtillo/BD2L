						get deleted and both parties spoken to for follow-up. Also, do not
						attack someone if they were unknowingly offensive; some people
						truly do not understand when they may be being offensive. Both

						by others before posting it. Try and avoid combining sensitive

						in the community to party up for pubs, and participate in
